# vimrc supported commands/keyboard shortcuts #

Help file for `vimrc` package set. Use `Ctrl+W` or the `X` button in the top
right corner to close.

## Release Notes (2016-04-24) ##

Tab functionality still not ideal, breaks `Ctrl+W` to save and quit (now have to
		run `Ctrl+W` to save and close tab, then `Ctrl+Q` to actually quit `vim`).
Trying to figure out a way to optionally close tab without saving, currently
have to run command `:bd!`.

## Commands ##

Run these commands in normal mode.

* `:Vimrc`:			Opens this help file
* `:VimrcUpdate`:	Updates (through git pull) the vimrc package set

## Keyboard Shortcuts ##

As always, with OS X, replace the `Ctrl` key with the `Cmd` key. Also, mouse
support is inconsistent with some versions of OSX, if it isn't working, try
`Ctrl+Click`.

### Standard Set ###

* `Ctrl+A`:			select all
* `Ctrl+C`:			copy selection
* `Ctrl+F`:			find, enter phrase and then enter to search, use `n`/`p` to
cycle through next/prev
* `Ctrl+Q`:			quit program, will fail and warn if no save (run `:q!` to
		force quit)
* `Ctrl+S`:			save
* `Ctrl+V`:			paste
* `Ctrl+X`:			cut selection
* `Ctrl+R`:			redo (not modified)
* `Ctrl+Z`:			undo

### Tab Functionality ###

Run `vim FILE1 FILE2 [FILE3 ...]` to open multiple files in vim, all in tabs
(really buffers, but they look like tabs).

* `Ctrl+T`:			open new tab, enter filename/path and then enter to open
* `Ctrl+W`:			save and close tab
* `Ctrl+->`:		move to next tab (note that `->` refers to rightarrow)
* `Ctrl+<-`:		move to prev tab

### Custom/Plugin Specific ###

* `F3`:				autoindent
* `F4`:				view directory contents
* `F5`:				show tree of edits (useful for undo)
* `F6`:				wraps selection to textwidth (justify)
* `F12`:			opens this page, same as `:Vimrc`
* `Ctrl+F12`:		updates the vimrc package set, same as `:VimrcUpdate`
