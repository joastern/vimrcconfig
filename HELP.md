# vimrc supported commands/keyboard shortcuts #

Help file for *vimrc* package set. Type `Ctrl+W` (or press the X at the top
right) to close.

## Commands ##

Run these commands in normal mode.

* `:Vimrc`:			Opens this help file
* `:VimrcUpdate`:	Updates (through git pull) the vimrc package set

## Keyboard Shortcuts ##

As always, with OS X, replace the `Ctrl` key with the `Cmd` key. Also, mouse
support is inconsistent with some versions of OSX, if it isn't working, try
`Ctrl+Click`.

### Standard Set ###

* `Ctrl+A`: 		select all
* `Ctrl+C`: 		copy selection (or current line, if not selected) to clipboard
* `Ctrl+F`: 		find (enter phrase then enter to search, cycle through
  results with `n` and `N`)
* `Ctrl+Q`: 		quit program, will fail and warn if not saved (run `:q!` to
  force quit) (inconsistent behavior)
* `Ctrl+S`: 		save
* `Ctrl+V`: 		paste from clipboard
* `Ctrl+W`: 		save and quit
* `Ctrl+X`: 		cut selection to clipboard
* `Ctrl+R`: 		redo (not modified)
* `Ctrl+Z`: 		undo

* `Ctrl+T`:			open new tab (enter filename/path and then enter to open)
* `Ctrl+W`:			save and close current tab
* `Ctrl+->`:		move to next tab (note that `->` refers to rightarrow)
* `Ctrl+<-`:		move to prev tab
