# vimrc #

*vimrc* is the name for the configuration file of the very cool terminal text
editor, *vim*. It modifies the behavior of the *vim* program itself through the
use of included settings, keybindings, and plugins on GitHub.

## Features ##

Below are a few of the more general features added to *vim* with this software:

* Line numbering
* Scroll support: Mousewheel, pgup/pgdn buttons
* Click to move cursor (Mac unstable, might need to use `Cmd+Click`)
* Drag to select text (Mac unstable, might need to use `Cmd+Click`)
* Enforced textwidth of 80 characters for code readability
* Spellcheck for text files
* Git diff display

It also adds a variety of intuitive keyboard shortcuts, documented in greater
detail in the [HELP.md](./HELP.md) page.

## Requirements ##

Besides the installation of *vim*, the below requirements are useful to have and
make installation easier, but are not strict requirements.

* Existing installation of *vim*
* *bash* or other Unix shell equivalent
* *make* utility
* *git* support, for downloading this repo

## Distribution ##

*vimrc* is distributed (installed and updated) through git, specifically through
this repo. All updates can be done through vim itself, by running
`:VimrcUpdate`.

### Installation ###

You can install *vimrc* in the default location by running the following 3 lines
in a terminal (location independent):

```
#!bash

git clone https://bitbucket.org/4U6U57/vimrc ~/bin/vimrc
cd ~/bin/vimrc
make
```

### Running vimrc ###

*vimrc* is just a configuration of *vim*, so running it is identical to running
`vim` normally.

For more information on the functionalities of *vimrc*, either check out the
`HELP.md` document, either [online](./HELP.md) or by running `:Vimrc` with
*vimrc* installed.

### Updates ###

Updates can be applied through *vim* itself, by running the command
`:VimrcUpdate` or keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+F12` in normal mode.

*vimrc* does not automatically update, to preserve changes you may have made to
the configuration. Update frequently to add additional functionality.

### Removal ###

*vimrc* can be easily uninstalled by navigating to the install directory
`~/bin/vimrc` and running `make spotless`. Note that this will not delete actual
install directory, only decoupling it from the *vim* program.

Reinstallation can be done by running `make` in the install directory, or by
following normal installation procedure if you havae already deleted it.
